### Day 1 turned out to be not just fun but genuinely inspiring. The highlight for me was watching videos featuring our college’s alumni—seeing their journeys made me think, “Maybe someday I’ll be celebrating as one of them.” Learning more about GNDEC—one of Punjab’s oldest and most respected engineering institutions—made me feel truly fortunate to have joined its legacy. Everything ran smoothly thanks to our seniors and the organizing team—their warm welcome and careful planning really made the day feel special, from the emotional Shabad Kirtan start to the heartfelt alumnus‑led talks—all part of GNDEC’s time‑honored way of bringing newcomers onboard. Walking around the campus, I noticed how alive it felt—everywhere I looked there were bright, eager minds, both among professors and students, sharing a buzz of energy and optimism. It was clear why alumni stay involved and why the college places so much value on connecting students with its broader network—just as the AICTE Student Induction Programme encourages bonding across batches, faculty, and future mentors.
